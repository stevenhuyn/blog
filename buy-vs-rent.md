From what I can tell owning and renting in an Australia capital city is only a matter of lifestyle, *not financial*.

Here are the intuition pumps 

Housing
- Leverage
- no CGT on PPOR
- Houses make 6%
- Property depreciates
- Upkeep
- Buy and Selling Costs
- Not Divesified aka high risk

Renting + ETFs
- Usually cheaper
- Rent normally grows with wage, not inflation
- ETFs make 10%
- Superannuation vehicle is tax efficient
- Moving Costs
- Diversified, gains are extremely consistent
